## Additionnal features

###### `VK_OEM_5` key produces `§` and `±` on Shift press
French AZERTY keyboards have a VK_OEM_5 key and a smaller shift key (usually it is a copy of the `\|` key ).
On a mac with international keyboard there is an extra `§±` key top left so I thought I would add those symbols back on this unused key.

_Hint_ : The § can be very useful in [Autohotkey hotstrings](http://ahkscript.org/) for text expansion :wink:
